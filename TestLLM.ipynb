    "The appraisal company undervalued the reviewer's house by purposely excluding unique pictures that would have accurately \n",
    "ssessed its value.\\\\n2. The uniqueness of the house was not taken into consideration, and the appraiser relied solely on comps \n",
    "that did not reflect its true worth.\\\\n3. The reviewer attempted to inform their loan officer about an American Express offer they \n",
    "wanted to apply for, which would have provided a $2,000 credit on their current bill.\\\\n4. The loan officer stated it was too late \n",
    "to take advantage of the offer as it would delay the process, despite the reviewer having just received the email and recently \n",
    "started the loan process.\\\\n5. The reviewer regrets not dropping the process and restarting it to benefit from the offer,\n",
    "as it would have helped them with their bill.\\\\n\\\\nReview:'''\\\\nFor the most part my experience was very quick and very easy. \n",
    "I did however, have 3 issues.\\\\n\\\\n#1 - When I received my final numbers, my costs were over $2000 more than was quoted to \n",
    "me over the phone. This was straightened out quickly and matched what I was quoted.\\\\n\\\\n#2 - The appraiser had to change \n",
    "his schedule and when I didn't know if I could be home for the appraisal, he said he could do it with me not there. \n",
    "I do not think this is a wise thing to do or to offer.\\\\n\\\\n#3 - When I received my appraisal, it was far lower than \n",
    "it should have been. My house appraised for basically the same price I purchased it for 14 years ago. I have kept the \n",
    "home up with flooring, paint, etc. It has new shingles on it from last summer, the driveway has been paved, I have about \n",
    "three acres landscaped compared to maybe one when I bought it, and have paved the driveway which was originally gravel.\\\\n\\\\nEven \n",
    "if you discount the insanely high prices that houses are selling for in today's market, the house has increased in value over \n",
    "the past fourteen years. In fact, some of the compared properties looked like camps that were not on water, had no basement or\n",
    "possibly no slab, and very minimal acreage. These comparably priced houses were in no way equal to my 4 bedroom cape, with \n",
    "a wraparound deck, on 4 acres, though not on the water, it is overlooking lake around 100 feet away at the most. I feel \n",

    "the quoted costs over the phone did not match the final numbers, resulting in a discrepancy of over $2000. However, this \n",
    "was promptly resolved.\\\\n3. The appraiser offered to conduct the appraisal without the homeowner present, which the reviewer \n",
    "felt was unwise and not recommended.\\\\n4. The appraisal value of the house was significantly lower than expected, even considering \n",
    "the current high housing market prices. The reviewer mentioned various upgrades and improvements made to the house over the past \n",
    "14 years.\\\\n5. The reviewer expressed a strong belief that the appraisal was deliberately set at a lower value to meet the \n",
    "requirements of the refinance loan, despite the property's unique features and advantages compared to the comparables \n",
